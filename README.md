# gender-detection-using-deep-learning
The code utilizes OpenCV and pre-trained models for face detection and gender prediction. Employing separate models, it detects faces with bounding boxes and predicts genders based on pre-trained weights. The annotated image demonstrates integrated deep learning in OpenCV for automated facial analysis and gender estimation.
